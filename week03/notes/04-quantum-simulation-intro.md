## Introduction

__Resonant circuits__ have progressed tremendously over the years.

A resonant circuit consists of inductors (L), capacitors (C), and sometimes resistors (R).  They naturally __oscillate__ at a specific resonant frequency.

The inductive reactance exactly cancels the capacitive reactance, resulting in __maximum current flow__ or __maximum energy storage__ with minimal impedance.

Coherent lifetimes have increased from a few nanoseconds to seconds.

The longest coherent lifetime achieved for a quantum resonant circuit today is __4 seconds__, demonstrated in superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) resonators at single-photon levels and millikelvin temperatures.


## Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices (NISQ)

One major area of development is algorithms compatible with NISQ technology.
