## Four Postulates of Quantum Mechanics

1. __Wavefunction__

A mathematical object called a _wavefunction_ describes the state of a quantum system.

The wavefunction contains all the accessible physical information about the system in that particular state.

2. __Operators__

An _observable_ is a measurable physical property of a quantum system.  Observables include position, momentum, and energy.

Every observable is represented by a corresponding mathematical _operator_ that acts on the wavefunction.

3. __Measurement and Collapse__

When a physical property is measured, the possible outcomes are restricted to the _eigenvalues_ of the corresponding operator.

After measurement, the quantum state instantaneously _collapses_ into a the specific state (eigenvector) associated with the measured eigenvalue.

4. __Time Evolution__

_Schr√∂dinger's equation_ governs how the state of a quantum system changes over time.

This equation describes the continuous and deterministic evolution of the wavefunction, showing how the system progresses from one state to another.

## Quantum Error Correction (QEC)

For QEC, we need more than just the Four Postulates of quantum mechanics.  We also need _classical statistics_.
