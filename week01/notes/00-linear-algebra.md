## Projector


## Transpose

A transpose of a vector _transforms_ the vector's orientation.

A row vector transforms into a column vector.  A column vector transforms into a row vector.

Example:

Vector ${v}$ is a column vector represented as _n_ rows and 1 column.

${v^T}$ becomes a row vector with 1 row and _n_ columns.

## Tensor Product

A tensor product is a mathematical operation that creates a new _vector space_ from two existing ones.

The properties of the two vector spaces are combined into a single, larger entity.

### Tensor Product in Quantum

In quantum, you must calculate the tensor product for a two-qubit system in order to create a _composite_ Hilbert space that can represent the _combined_ state of the two individiual qubits, their interactions and correlations, such as _entanglement_.
