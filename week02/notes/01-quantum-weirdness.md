## Introduction

Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR 1935)

- Einstein argued that quantum mechanics is incomplete.

- Einstein used position and momentum.

But we're discussing _discrete_ quantum mechanics, so we'll talk about 'up' or 'down,' 0 or 1.

## John Bell

In November 1964, John Bell published a seminal paper in _Physics_ called "On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen Paradox."

Bell concluded that the arguments of quantum mechanics _contradict_ classical probability theory.

## Bell's Argument

Talk about it as a game that two players are trying to cooperatively play.

We'll call it the CHSH game.  Alice and Bob are playing a game.  They want to cooperate and win with as high a probability as possible.

The referee doesn't make any decisions.  He flips coins and does what the instructions tell him.

## Bell's Game

Inspired by Bell's theorem, the game demonstrates the differences between classical and quantum correlations.

The CHSH game (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) is a thought experiment used to demonstrate quantum entanglement and test Bell's inequalities.

Here are the game moves:

1. Alice and Bob are in separate rooms and cannot communicate with each other.

1. Alice and Bob each receive a _random_ input bit from a referee.  Alice receives ${x}$ and Bob receives ${y}$.

1. They each produce an _output_ bit based on their input bit and shared entangled quantum state. Alice produces ${a}$ and Bob produces ${b}$.

1. They send their output bits to the referee, who checks if the winning condition is met:

    ${a \oplus b = x y}$

    The XOR of their outputs equals the AND of their inputs.

### How does the CHSH game work?

Because Alice and Bob are spatially separated and cannot communicate during the game, they rely on their shared entangled state and pre-agreed strategy to produce correlated results.

The non-communication is crucial to demonstrate that any correlation in their outputs comes from the entangled states, not from classical communication.

### What does correlated outputs mean?

The outputs are correlated if they are _not_ random with respect to each other and, instead, exhibit a predictable relationship due to the shared quantum entangled state.

Using a shared entangled state, Alic and Bob can produce outputs that satisfy the winning condition with a higher probability (up to 85%) than is possible with a classical strategy (max ~75%).
