# Entanglement as a Physical Resource

Saturday, October 11, 2025

## Topics

1. Entanglement - Definition and Mathematical Measures

2. Fungibility of Entanglement

## Resource Model of Quantum Information Theory

Prof. Isaac Chuang, MIT

Space, time, and energy are fundamental physical resources.

Does quantum information theory introduce additional physical resources?

  - Could noisy quantum channels be resources?

  - Could entangled quantum states be resources?

## Uses of Entanglement

1. Teleportation

    - 1 ebit (entangled bit) + 2 classical bits --> 1 qubit

2. Superdense coding

    - 1 ebit + 1 qubit --> 2 cbits (classical bits)

3. Clock synchronization

4. Distributed computation

5. Cryptography

## What is a resource?

### Criterion 1: Strict Equivalence

A & B are equivalent if a mechanism exists to convert A -> B and B -> A.

Does this apply to entangled states?

### Criterion 2: Asymptotic Equivalence

ex) U.S. dollars and British pounds

These currencies are equivalent because there exists an __exchange rate__ to convert between the two for a __fixed fee__.

Think of ${R}$ as the exchange rate and $\delta$ as the fee.

Do entangled states have a well-defined notion of asymptotic equivalence?

## What is Quantum Entanglement?

The pure state $\ket{\psi}_{AB}$ of a composite system is entangled if, and only if: 

  - there does not exist a pure state $\ket{\phi}_{A}$ and $\ket{\chi}_{B}$

  - such that $\ket{\psi}_{AB} = \ket{\phi}_{A} \otimes \ket{\chi}_{B}$

The entanglement, $E$, is defined as the Von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix on A or the reduced density matrix on B.
