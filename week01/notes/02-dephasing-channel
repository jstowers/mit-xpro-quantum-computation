## Introduction

To be useful, quantum computers must be built from _robust_ elements.

Gate fidelity is one metric that quantifies the robustness of a qubit.

## Gate Fidelity

Gate fidelity measures the _accuracy_ of a quantum gate's operation.

Expressed as a percent (e.g. 99.9%), gate fidelity quantifies how closely the gate's actual execution on a physical quantum computer matches the ideal, noise-free intended operation.

Intuitively, gate fidelity is related to the _number_ of gates, on average, that can be applied to a qubit before an error occurs and the qubit state is lost.

## Loss of Quantum Information

There are two fundamental ways that a qubit can lose quantum information:

1. __energy exchange with the environment__ - this is related to the coherence time, ${t_1}$

2. __dephasing__ - a loss of coherence in the superposition state

The coherence time, ${t_2}$, is related to both the energy exchange and dephasing processes.

## Treating Qubit Error

This section will discuss one method to treat qubit error on the Bloch sphere using _probabilistic error channels_ based on qubit gates.

This model provides a simple visualization of concepts like depolarization and dephasing as represented by a density matrix.

## Quantum Channels

A quantum channel is a _probablistic mixture_ of simple channels.

### Dephasing Channel

The simplest channel is the dephasing channel.  

A dephasing channel introducs noise by randomizing the phases of a quantum system.  The system loses its coherence and transitions to a classical-like _probabilitic mixture_ of states.

1. probability ${1-p}$ 

    Do nothing.  Apply the identity operator.

2. probability ${p}$

    Apply the Z-gate (${\sigma_z}$).

    The Z-gate is a single-qubit gate that leaves the $\ket{0}$ unchanged but flips the phase of the $\ket{1}$ state to negative, resulting in a change to $\ket{-1}$.

    In matrix notation, the Z-gate is represented as:

    $Z = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & -1\\\end{pmatrix}$

### Example

Begin with a quantum state $\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1}$.  Place it into the dephasing channel:

(1-p) probability:      

  $\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1}$

p probability:          

  $\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1}$


The density matrix, $\rho$ is expressed as a sum over all possible states:

  $\rho = \displaystyle\sum_{i} p_i\ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i}$

  $(1-p)(\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})(\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1}) + p(\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})(\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})$
